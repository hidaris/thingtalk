* Scalability -- Can be based on MQTT to achieve distributed deployment.
* Standards-based -- Compatibility with community standards[WoT].
* Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to FastAPI).
* Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
